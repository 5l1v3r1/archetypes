Well paid jobs require abilities, skills and knowledge. The O*Net database maps the profiles for a wealth of occupations. Wages of people working in these occupations is available in the US Census ACS/PUMS database. With all the data available, top quality research and huge economic resources being put into human resources, still **only one out of twenty people have a job that fits them and that engages them**.  One big challenge is the high degree of complexity in our rapidly changing world. 

We are used to looking at what jobs require from people. But that is not working as well as it used to. Occupations are changing or disappearing at a high speed and confusion follows.. In this project I explore how data science can be used to construct a simple language for jobs and abilities that teams and individuals can use in daily speech. It is related to Jungian psychology and ‘archetypes’, like in the  ‘Myers-Briggs’ personality test, that already are in use in HR.  It has two components: 

1. Unsupervised machine learning (NMF): Construct ‘archetypes’:

2. Supervised machine learning connect archetypes to income statistics. When using all measured abilities, skills and knowledge as features (120 variables), ‘ball-park numbers’ for wages can be predicted for occupations. Predicted income vs actual income is shown in the figure. The goal for achetypes is to provide a simpler,  intuitive human language for understanding and planning the interaction between people with abilities and the occupations that fit them, as well as for applying to Data Science, maintaining predictive power.
